The majority of files in this directory come from Prototype
and Scriptaculous - two JavaScript libraries that make Ajax
easier.

http://prototype.conio.net (version 1.5.0_rc1)
http://script.aculo.us (version 1.6.4)

The Prototype framework consists of a single file: prototype.js.

The Script.aculo.us framework consists of six files:

builder.js
controls.js
dragdrop.js
effects.js
scriptaculous.js
slider.js

By including scriptaculous.js in your pages, all the rest of
the files are included as well.
