### when set to true, WebWork will act much more friendly for developers. This
### includes:
### - webwork.i18n.reload = true
### - webwork.configuration.xml.reload = true
### - raising various debug or ignorable problems to errors
###   For example: normally a request to foo.action?someUnknownField=true should
###                be ignored (given that any value can come from the web and it
###                should not be trusted). However, during development, it may be
###                useful to know when these errors are happening and be told of
###                them right away.
webwork.devMode=false

### Configuration reloading
### This will cause the configuration to reload xwork.xml when it is changed
webwork.configuration.xml.reload=true

### workaround for some app servers that don't handle HttpServletRequest.getParameterMap()
### often used for WebLogic, Orion, and OC4J
