        Adding more <class>f.q.c.Name</class> elements here is not required.  
        The annotated classes will still be detected, as can be observed in the 
        following log output:
        
        INFO [main] Ejb3Configuration.scanForClasses(652) | found EJB3 Entity bean: com.mycompany.model.Person
        
        That being said, it will still work if you do add your <class> 
        declarations here for clarity, simply as a way to explicitly see all the 
        classes that are mapped as persistent entities.  Do whatever blows your 
        skirt up.
