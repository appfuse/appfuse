AppFuse Basic Spring MVC Archetype
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you're reading this then you've created your new project using Maven and
appfuse-basic-spring.  You have only created the shell of an AppFuse Java EE
application.  The project object model (pom) is defined in the file pom.xml.
The application is ready to run as a web application. The pom.xml file is
pre-defined with Hibernate as a persistence model and Spring MVC as the web
framework.

To get started, please complete the following steps:

1. Download and install a MySQL 5.x database from 
   http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.0.html#downloads.

2. Run "mvn jetty:run" and view the application at http://localhost:8080.
