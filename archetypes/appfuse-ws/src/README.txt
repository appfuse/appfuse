AppFuse Web Services Archetype
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you're reading this then you've created your new project using Maven and
appfuse-ws.  You have only created the shell of an AppFuse Java EE
application.  The project object model (pom) is defined in the file pom.xml.
The application is ready to serve up web services with Enunciate and CXF. The
pom.xml file is pre-defined with Hibernate as a persistence model. To change it,
please read http://appfuse.org/display/APF/Persistence.

To get started, please complete the following steps:

1. Download and install a MySQL 5.x database from 
   http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.0.html#downloads.

2. Run "mvn jetty:run" and view the application at http://localhost:8080.
